I've been reading up on JavaScript and came upon an excellent explanation for Regular Expressions that I wanted to share. You can find it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">here</a>. The examples on this page are much clearer than any of the python resources I read when first learning how to use Regular Expressions in Django.
