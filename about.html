    <p>Hi there. My name's Gabe. I'm a computer nerd interested in most things web-development, databases, machine learning, and GIS. I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com">JazzHR</a>, formerly known as <em>Jazz</em> as well as <em>The Resumator</em>. In my free time I enjoy fiddling with programming projects, minimalist long-distance running, woodworking, playing video-games, traveling, photography, looking at silly pictures on the internet, and spending time with my cats.</p>
    <p>I'm a proponent of open source software and appreciate its many communities.</p>
    <p>At <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com">JazzHR</a> we maintain a complex PHP application that provides small businesses with tools to help them collaborate and make better hiring decisions. We've been porting our product from a legacy 'MVC-like' legacy application to a heavy front-end client and a RESTful HTTP API. I've been involved in many technical aspects of the product, from front-end architecture to back-end architecture to data and domain modeling to testing, you name it.</p>
    <p>I open source most of my personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/gabrielmiller">my github account</a>. Feel free to fork a project or contribute! Also feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/lgabrielmiller">twitter</a>.</p>
    <p>This blog is comprised of personal thoughts, work, and projects unless otherwise noted. None of the opinions expressed within represent those of my employer.</p>
